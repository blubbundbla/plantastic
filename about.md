I am an evolutionary botanist, who studies why species diversify. I use phylogenetic data and compaarative methods to understand how biodiversity is generated and maintained across space and time.  My name is Martha Kandziora and currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Merced developing software tools to automatically update phylogenies, by heart I am a plant scientist.
