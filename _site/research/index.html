<em>The Cape Floristic Region</em></p>

<p>There are mainly two hypothesis, why the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is a diversity hotspot. Either it is a speciation hotspot or a region with reduced extinction.  Currently, I investigate the biogeographic history of the genus <em>Erica</em>, one of the largest monophyletic clades there (Pirie et al., in prep). We use climatic niche, phylogenetic reconstruction and biogeography to get more insights into its unknown history. Before, in parallel to my doctoral research, we could already show, that the diversity of <em>Erica</em> is due to increased speciation rate after dispersal from the Palaearctic, with an additional speciation rate shift within the large Cape clade (Pirie et al., 2016). This complies with the idea of the CFR being a speciation hot-bed. The speciation burst, might be related to the opening of niches and the relatively mild effects of the northern hemispheric Pliocene glacial cycles in the Cape.</p>

<em>Senecio transmarinus a tropcial Afroalpine species</em></p>

<p>As PhD project, I studied the evolution of one of the largest plant genera, <em>Senecio</em> (Asteraceae). It belongs to the tribe Senecioneae and the evolutionary history of the tribe is still mostly unknown, due to several hybridization events, incomplete lineage sorting, the high amount of species and unknown synapomorphies. My research focused on the genus in the strict sense. The latest phylogenetic work (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25065905?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Pelser et al. 2007</a>) reconstructed the history of the tribe and included about 180 species of approximately 1000 <em>Senecio</em> species. I extended the sampling with an emphasis on African and Afroalpine species and used phylogenetic methods to understand the evolution of the genus, the historical biogeography as well as some macroecological patterns within the genus.</p>

<p>According to my findings <em>Senecio</em> evolved during the Mid- to Late Miocene in the arid or semi-arid regions of Southern Africa. Due to the species diversity and its age, it has a relatively high speciation rate compared to many other groups and is one of the very few genera that have nearly a cosmopolitan distribution. 
From its southern African origin species colonized the world. I could show that two lineages independently colonized the Palaearctic from two distinct sources, once from the dry regions to the areas around the Mediterranean Basin and once from mountainous regions, either of the Drakensbergs or the tropical Afroalpine regions, to the mountainous regions of the Palaearctic (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12837/abstract">Kandziora et al, 2017</a>). Thus both lineages colonizing the Palaearctic kept their broad scale ancestral niche. Furthermore, many species found in the drier regions of southern Africa and the Mediterranean Basin are annuals, while most other species are perrenials.</p>

<em>Dendrosenecio stands in the Rwenzori Mountains</em></p>

<p>Another aspect of my project was, to investigate the colonization history of <em>Senecio</em> into the tropcial Afroalpine. It is a unique continental habitat island system with distinct climatic conditions. The climate varies daily from warm to freezing temperature. Many species have evolved adaptations to this kind of climate, such as the famous <em>Dendrosenecio</em> species, that are only distantly related to <em>Senecio</em>. I wanted to know if the species of the Afroalpine migrated from tropical regions and adapted to the conditions or if they were coming from distant temperate sources. I was able to show that the region was colonized several times (5-15) independently from distant regions and dispersal between the mountains seems to be more important than in situ speciation (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3732/ajb.1600210/full">Kandziora et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h3 id="evolution-of-dwarf-shrub-habit-in-alpine-like-environments">Evolution of dwarf-shrub habit in alpine-like environments</h3>

<p>During my master project, I studied the evolution of the dwarf shrub habit in relation to colonizing new habitats (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/117/1/121/2195968">Gehrke et al. 2015</a>). The dwarf shrub habit is an adaptation to alpine-like environments. I was able to show, that non-woody species evolved the dwarf shrub habit at least twice and that this is connected to the colonization of alpine-like environments. Nevertheless, the evolution of the dwarf shrub habit did not increase the diversification rate of these lineages.</p>
