### Development of workflows and tools for macroevolutionary research

I develop tools and workflows to increase reproducibility in research. Phylogenetic relationships of species are important if we want to study the diversification of lineages and the relations to ecological niches, biogeography and traits. I developed a tool to [automatically update alignments based on custom sampling strategies](https://github.com/blubbundbla/PhylUp/tree/master). Colleagues and me also developed a [python tool](https://github.com/McTavishLab/physcraper) to easily and automatic update phylogenies using OpenTreeOfLife. Currently under development are workflows to analyze the climatic conditions of areas. 

### Radiations in tropical alpine regions

Past and current changes in the environment are influencing diversification. How diversification differs between two separate but similar environments is the focus of my current work. Together with colleagues from Charles university, we focus on the evolution of Asteraceae lineages across tropical alpine regions of South America and East Africa to understand how past climatic changes and mountain building processes drive diversification. Together with colleagues from Norway, I am currently investigating the age of the East African Flora.

### Evolution of *Erica*

*The Cape Floristic Region*

There are mainly two hypothesis, why the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is a diversity hotspot. Either it is a speciation hotspot or a region with reduced extinction.  We are investigating the biogeographic history of the genus *Erica*, one of the largest monophyletic clades in the CFR ([Pirie et al., 2018](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0764-3)). We use climatic niche, phylogenetic and biogeography reconstructions to get more insights into its unknown history. Me and colleagues showed, that the diversity of *Erica* is due to increased speciation rate after dispersal from the Palaearctic, with an additional speciation rate shift within the large Cape clade (Pirie et al., 2016). This complies with the idea of the CFR being a speciation hot-bed. The best fitting biogreographic model is based on a combination of ecological similarity and physical distance. Contrary to this general rule, dispersal to regions which are more dissimilar and further away were important for the diversification of the genus ([Pirie et al, 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/290791v5)). The speciation burst might be related to the opening of niches and the relatively mild effects of the northern hemispheric Pliocene glacial cycles in the Cape. 


### Evolution of *Senecio* and it's biogeographic history

*Dendrosenecio stands in the Rwenzori Mountains*


The tropcial Afroalpine is a unique continental habitat island system with distinct climatic conditions. The climate varies daily from warm to freezing temperature. Many species have evolved adaptations to this climate, such as the famous *Dendrosenecio* species. Do species within this unique habitat adapt from regions with tropical climatic conditions or from more distant temperate sources? *Senecio* another genus within the tribe is the largest genus in the region and one of the largest plant genera worldwide. The genus belongs to the tribe Senecioneae within the daisy family (Asteraceae). The evolutionary history of the tribe is still mostly unknown, due to several hybridization events, incomplete lineage sorting, the high amount of species and unknown synapomorphies. The genus is not monophyletic and synapomorphies are not known. I used collection based and phylogenetic methods to understand the evolution of the genus, the historical biogeography as well as some macroecological patterns within the genus. The genus colonized the region several times (5-15) independently from distant regions and dispersal between the mountains seems to be more important than in situ speciation ([Kandziora et al. 2016](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3732/ajb.1600210/full)).

*Senecio transmarinus a tropcial Afroalpine species*

*Senecio* sensu strictu evolved during the Mid- to Late Miocene in the arid or semi-arid regions of Southern Africa. Due to the species diversity and its age, it has a relatively high speciation rate compared to many other groups and is one of the very few genera that have nearly a cosmopolitan distribution. From its southern African origin species colonized the world. Two lineages independently colonized the Palaearctic from two distinct sources but retaining their broad scale ecological niche ([Kandziora et al. 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12837/abstract)).


### Evolution of dwarf-shrub habit in alpine-like environments

Do dwarf shrubs show higher speciation rates compared to their closely related non-woody species?  The dwarf shrub habit is an adaptation to alpine-like environments. I was able to show, that non-woody species of  African *Alchemilla* evolved the dwarf shrub habit at least twice and that this is connected to the colonization of alpine-like environments. Nevertheless, the evolution of the dwarf shrub habit did not increase the diversification rate of these lineages ([Gehrke et al. 2015](https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/117/1/121/2195968)).
